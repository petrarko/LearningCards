<h1>Learn it!</h1>
<h2>Version: 1.0</h2>
<h3>This program is designed to learn by heart any words, terminology etc assuming the following
    algorithm: take a photo of your term on a first step of "Take a photo" and take a photo of
    term's explanation after that. You can learn terms just trying to remember what does it mean and
    rotate your card if you forgot a meaning. Feel free to use "Invert" or "Invert all" if you need
    to lean terms by explanation.&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Gratitude.</h2>
