# Learn it!

## Version: 1.0

### This program is designed to learn by heart any words, terminology etc assuming the following algorithm: take a photo of your term on a first step of "Take a photo" and take a photo of term's explanation after that. You can learn terms just trying to remember what does it mean and rotate your card if you forgot a meaning. Feel free to use "Invert" or "Invert all" if you need to lean terms by explanation.Â 

## Gratitude.
